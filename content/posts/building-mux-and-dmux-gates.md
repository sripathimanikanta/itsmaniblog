## Mux
#### What is multiplexer??
A. Mulitpler as it called as MUX in short. It takes multiple inputs (signal/pulse) and gives single output(signals). 
 Basically MUX selects one of several inputs.

## DMux
#### What is demultiplex??
A. As you might have guessed by the name,its quiet opposite to mux.De-Mulitpler as it called as DMUX in short. It takes single input (signal/pulse) and gives multiple outputs(signals). 
 Basically DMUX routes single input to the right output.
