### Transistors
These are switches that make all the magic happen. Like watching a movie with family,
playing games with your friends, doing all the office work in word, etc..,

> Q - Wait what??? when i heard about that i was so *shocked* and *amazed* at the same time??

My first question was 
- [Why we need switches??](#q---why-do-we-need-switches)
- Why transistor (this special switch)?? What is so special about this??
- How these switches are related to GATES??
- How does transistor works?? (let's leave this question for further discussion)

So let's start tackling these questions one by one.

### Q - Why do we need switches??
First of all, we want to use electricity to remember values like numbers, letters, etc..,
But we only have 2 option. 
> ON or OFF

in other words, it is called ***BINARY***(computer jargon). It means 2.

Many Brillant minds, after thinking and trying and failing to use other properties of electricity.

> So, here the challenge how would you use this property of ON and OFF to store anything???

so they came up with a solution, like 

### Q - Why Transistor?? why only that??
So we can use other switches like 
- our normal switches
- Relays

So, if we look into the history its not like our ANCESTORS didn't make a computers using
these traditional switches, in fact they made some of the crazy sized machines using just these 

If we use these mechanical switches, few reasons things will happen:
1. They are all mechanical so they get wear-tear
2. 
2. Its hard to find which relay has dead.

The computers which used *Relays*
